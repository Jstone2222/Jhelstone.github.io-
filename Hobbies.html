         <p>I enjoy spending time with family and being outdoors. One of the most beautiful places I have ever visited was Hawaii. There are many trails to hike and explore on each one of the islands. My family is from South America, from a little
            country called Suriname. There are many rainforests and rivers there since it is so close to the Amazon. I have visited many times and I always enjoy exploring the rivers and forests when I have a chance. I enjoy spending time with family
            when I can, and we always have a good food, love, and laughter.
